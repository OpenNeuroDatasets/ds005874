## fMRIPrep
fMRIPrep v1.10.0 was run on the dataset to perform the following spatial preprocessing:
* slice-timing correction
* realignment
* co-registration
* segmentation

## PhysIO
To account for physiological noise originating from respiration and cardiac activity, the PhysIO toolbox (R2022a-v8.1.0) was used to process breathing belt and pulse oximetry data, creating eight regressors for respiration and six regressors for cardiac activity.
