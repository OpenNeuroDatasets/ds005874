# An fMRI Dataset for Appetite Neural Correlates in People Living with Motor Neuron Disease

This is a motor neuron disease (MND) imaging dataset generated by the Steyn/Ngo Lab at the University of Queensland, Australia. Imaging was conducted at the Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF) at Brisbane, Australia.

The raw BIDS data was created using BIDScoin 2.3.1
All provenance information and settings can be found in ./code/bidscoin
For more information see: https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin

Anatomical volumes were refaced using mri_reface 0.3.3
The code can be found in ./code/reface_structural.sh

Identifiable volumes under the derivatives dataset derivatives/fmriprep-v23.1.4 were removed.

## Protocol change for sub-43
For this patient we used the 20 channel coil instead of the 64 channel coil as the 64 channel coil did not fit the patients head. Due to the coil change there were a few modifications to the imaging protocol as listed below:
PA multiband diffusion block changes:
TE changed from 84 ms to 89 ms
TR changed from 4700 ms to 5200ms
Multiband diffusion AP block 1 changes:
TE changed from 84 ms to 89 ms
TR changed from 4700 ms to 5200ms
AP multiband diffusion block 2 changes:
TE changed from 84ms to 89 ms
TR changed from 4700 ms to 5200 ms
